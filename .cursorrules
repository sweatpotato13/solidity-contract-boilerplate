# CodeRabbit CLI Integration
- Run CodeRabbit before finalizing: coderabbit --prompt-only -t uncommitted
- Limit to 2 runs per feature to avoid over-analysis
- Always address "critical" and "security" findings immediately

# Code Style
- Functions over 50 lines need refactoring
- Max 3 levels of nesting - flatten if possible
- Early returns over deep if/else chains

# Testing Requirements
- Every new function needs at least one test
- Test edge cases, not just happy paths
- Mock external dependencies
